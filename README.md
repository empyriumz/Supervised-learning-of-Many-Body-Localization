# Supervised-learning-of-Many-Body-Localization
A simple neural network structure to classify many-body localized and thermalized phases using entanglement spectrum as the input data

With moderate amount of data O(10^5), the classifier achieves nearly 100% accuracy on the test set.

# Requirement
Python 3.5+

Tensorflow

[Quspin](https://github.com/weinbe58/QuSpin) (for calculating the entanglement spectrum)
